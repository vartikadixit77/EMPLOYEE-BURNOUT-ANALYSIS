This project leverages data analysis and predictive modeling to provide actionable insights for improving employee well-being and productivity.
Employee Burnout Analysis


Overview


Employee burnout is a critical issue in workplaces today, characterized by physical and emotional fatigue due to chronic workplace stress.                                                                       This project employs machine learning techniques to analyze employee-related factors and predict burnout levels.                                                                                                 
 The aim is to provide actionable insights for organizations to address burnout effectively and enhance workplace well-being.
